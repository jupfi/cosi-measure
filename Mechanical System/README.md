# Mechanical System

Here you can find all necessary files to reproduce the COSI Measure mechanical setup.

Please read the [assembly documentation](2024-09-02_cosi-measure_v2.0_mechanical_assembly_instructions.md) first, in particular you will find some known issues or useful ideas in the comments section, which will help you reproducing the design.

## Folder: Aluplates

3D CAD models and technical drawings of the individual components. You need to mill these parts from aluminum plates. If you don't have access to a CNC mill, you can also have this done by an external company. 

## Folder: Complete System

3D CAD model of the complete system.

## Folder: Limit switch holder

3D CAD models of the limit switch holders

Please note that the following assembly instruction has not been updated yet to the new limit switch holders. For the new design refer to this pictures:

![Endstops 1](docs/endstops-1.jpg)

![Endstops 2](docs/endstops-2.jpg)

The outer limit switch is triggering the safe-torque-off (aka emergency stop). Thus the machine can not kill itself no matter what the software is trying to execute.
