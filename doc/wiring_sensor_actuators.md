# Wiring sensors and actuators

<!--For cable selection keep in mind, that most cables must be for moving cable chain applications. Use shielded cables for the motors.-->

## Cable Chains
We have a total of three cable chains.

## Motors

### Motor Housing

For wiring the stepper motors you first want to 3D print the motor housings and then add the GX20 connectors. The STL file can be found [here]().
