## Description

COSI Measure is an open source multipurpose 3-axis robot operating in a large volume, that can be equipped with e.g. field mapping probes for static or dynamic field measurements (electromagnetic, temperature etc.). Submillimeter fidelity and reproducibility/backlash performance were evaluated experimentally. It can be potentially upgraded to be used as a CNC, for 3D printing or other applications, that require reproducible submillimeter movements.

## System specifications

- Dimension: (80x90x105)cm³
- Working volume: (53x53x64)cm³
- Precision: positioning error <1mm
- Max load: ~20kg
- Applied force: 896N (91kg)
- Standalone system
- Inductive limit switches
- Emergency Stop
- Open Source Software GUI (Python)
- Estimated material costs: ~2000€
